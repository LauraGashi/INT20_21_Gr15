        <h1  style="margin-inline-end: 15px;">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</h1>

              <p>
                  To protect ourselves from the virus:
                <br/>
                    Clean your hands often.
                    Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
                    Limit social gatherings and time spent in crowded places.
                    Avoid close contact with someone who is sick.

                  <p> While COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, can lead to hospitalization and
         even death for young and middle-aged adults, it has caused the most severe health issues for 
         adults over the age of 60 — with particularly fatal results for those 80 years and older.</p>

                      <p>Based on data so far, doctors believe that 1%-3% of people with COVID-19 will get conjunctivitis, also called pinkeye. It happens when the virus infects a tissue called conjunctiva, which covers the white part of your eye or the inside of your eyelids. </p>
