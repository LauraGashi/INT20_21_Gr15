        <strong>Shortness of breath </strong>is more likely to 
        be a warning sign of COVID-19 
         if it's accompanied by a fever, cough, or body aches. 
         On average, shortness of breath tends to set in around
          4 to 10 days after you contract an infection with the new coronavirus.
           Shortness of breath may be mild and not last long.
